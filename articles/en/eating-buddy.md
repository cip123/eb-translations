Hey there! If you are reading this, I will assume that you have had your fair share of diets. And, while some worked better than others, in the end, they all felt like an unwinnable race.

Whether you are counting calories, restricting carbs, or practicing intermittent fasting, it always goes down the same way. You see quick initial results, then the progress slows down as things get tougher, you eventually lift the restrictions, and then you gain the weight back.

I know this too well. My experience with diets began in my teens, right after I started consuming an excess of processed foods and gained a lot of weight. In response, I turned to extreme diets – anything that promised quick results, from eating just a grapefruit per day to the "10 pounds in 7 days" cabbage soup diet. 

But no diet ever fixed the real issue. In fact, every diet made things worse. Each new restriction only strengthened my obsession with food.

Then I learned that there’s such a thing as food addiction, and it finally made sense. Many modern foods are engineered to hijack your brain’s reward system.

Here’s how it works. When you eat something enjoyable, your brain releases dopamine, a chemical that signals pleasure and motivation. It’s the same system that helps you seek out things that keep you alive, like eating, drinking, or connecting with others.

But when foods are designed to hit that system too hard, especially combinations of fat, sugar, and salt, dopamine spikes much higher than it should. Your brain starts to associate those foods with intense reward. The next time you see or even think about them, the brain remembers that “hit” and pushes you to get it again.

Over time, the normal balance breaks. You stop eating for nourishment and start eating to chase that feeling. Natural foods begin to feel bland, and moderation becomes harder.

Dieting makes this cycle louder. The more you restrict, the more your brain becomes alert to anything related to food: smells, images, even the thought of eating. So when you finally eat the foods you’ve been avoiding, dopamine spikes higher than normal, making it almost impossible to stop. It’s not a lack of willpower — it’s how your reward system reacts to deprivation and anticipation.

The good news: the brain can rebalance. When you consistently eat real, balanced meals and reduce constant exposure to hyper-palatable foods, dopamine responses begin to normalize. Pleasure from simple, natural foods returns, and the cycle of craving weakens.

That's why we created **Eating Buddy**. It's built around three key ideas

**No Food Is Off-Limits.** The moment you forbid a food, your brain turns it into an obsession. You don’t have to give it up, just stay aware of how it affects you. Notice when a food leaves you calm and satisfied versus when it makes you crave more. Awareness weakens the addiction loop.
 
**Eat With Intention.** Before you reach for a snack, pause and ask, “Why am I eating?” Is it hunger, habit, or an urge? Making eating a conscious choice helps you separate your body’s real needs from automatic impulses.

**Slow Down and Enjoy Your Food** When you rush, your brain misses the subtle pleasure in ordinary foods and keeps chasing stronger hits. Slow eating, even with simple meals, teaches your brain to get dopamine from balanced, ‘bland’ foods, not just from the extreme combinations of fat, sugar, and salt. That’s how you retrain your reward system.
