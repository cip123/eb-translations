During a long company meeting, we had to pause at some point to order food, and everybody wanted pizza. I had just come out of a long, no-carb diet, and pizza was my Nemesis. However, I needed to eat, and I thought to myself: "What the hell? I can have a slice or two; it's not the end of the world."

Ten minutes later, I had eaten so much that I found myself staring at the empty boxes, mumbling: "I don't know what's gotten into me." My boss, who stayed next to me the entire time, said with a smirk: "I know what's gotten into you: six slices did ." 

That was the moment I realized how deep the cycle ran. The more I restricted, the more my brain obsessed over the foods I was trying to avoid.

Things began to change when I started working on rebalancing that system. Instead of cutting out food groups, I began to eat full, balanced meals that my body understood - real food with natural levels of protein, carbs, and fat.

It didn’t happen overnight, but little by little, things started to shift. Now pizza is just another thing on the menu I can have whenever I want. I even learned to make it myself, the original Neapolitan way, with nothing but flour, water, salt, tomato sauce, olive oil and mozzarella cheese. No tricks, no engineered flavors, just real ingredients my body understands.Now, I eat it once in a while, but I only finish it when it's really good.

When you stop swinging between restriction and overindulgence, things start to settle. Your brain finds its balance again, and food starts to feel normal. It becomes satisfying without being addictive, a simple way to nourish yourself instead of chasing a rush or looking for comfort.
