Weekends usually come with a mix of emotions: relief, boredom, loneliness, or celebration.

You finally get a break from the week and want to relax. Maybe there is a social event, a dinner at your favorite restaurant, a trip, or just time at home with good food. These moments should feel enjoyable, but they often lead to overeating and the promise to “start again” on Monday.

### Breaking the weekend cycle

The key is awareness. Each meal is a chance to notice what is really happening. Are you eating because you are hungry or because you feel stressed, tired, or need comfort?

Weekends are the best time to practice this. Without weekday routines, your habits and triggers show more clearly. Paying attention now helps you understand what drives your eating the rest of the week.

Eating Buddy helps you do this by guiding you to log meals and check in with yourself before or after eating. It is not about counting calories or judging yourself, but about noticing patterns and reconnecting with what your body truly needs.

That is the goal of the Weekend Streak challenge. Use it to stay aware of how and why you eat when life feels more open and unstructured.

Each logged meal builds awareness. With time, you will notice fewer urges, steadier energy, and the feeling of freedom that comes from breaking free of food addiction.
